## üß± Platform Overview: Channels, Streams, Quests, and Relays

### 1. What Is NOIZ as a Platform?

**NOIZ** is a creator-first live streaming ecosystem that reimagines how digital support and infrastructure work together.

Unlike traditional platforms that prioritize monetization through fiat currency or advertising, NOIZ centers its economy around **Decibels** ‚Äî a virtual support token system. This framing allows NOIZ to foster community-driven growth, non-exploitative monetization, and meaningful interaction across the platform.

Rather than relying on centralized server farms, NOIZ is powered by a decentralized relay infrastructure, hosted by users who contribute bandwidth and routing (Pathweavers). The entire system is designed to be lightweight, scalable, and fair ‚Äî without relying on crypto, ads, or pay-to-win mechanics.

### 2. Channels: Your Creator Hub

Each verified user on NOIZ has a **channel** ‚Äî their home base for broadcasting, engaging with viewers, and customizing their community experience.

A NOIZ channel includes:

* Your live video stream (with viewer-adjustable quality and latency settings)
* A custom channel banner, bio, and linked socials
* A fully-featured chat system with moderation controls and plugin-based bot support
* The ability to set up **Reverb** (channel points), visual badges, and engage with platform-wide **Quests**
* Channel-specific boosts, overlays, and command shortcuts

Viewers passively earn **Reverb** just by being present and interacting, which can then be spent on channel-specific redemptions, visual effects, or boosts.

Channels evolve automatically as creators grow ‚Äî new tools and cosmetic unlocks are added through milestone progression.

### 3. Streams: How Broadcasting Works on NOIZ

NOIZ supports streaming via two main methods:

* **NOIZ Studio**, a customized fork of OBS built for native integration
* **Standard OBS**, modified to work with NOIZ‚Äôs ITGl routing protocol

Low-latency streaming is enabled by default to allow real-time interaction. This is especially important for features like **Quests**, **Boosts**, and **Vibe-based interactions**.

Additional stream capabilities include:

* Embedded streams on external websites
* Boosted visibility through Reverb or Decibel contributions
* Raiding into other creators' channels
* Eligibility for **Echostage**, NOIZ‚Äôs dynamic spotlight system

Unlike other platforms with fixed bitrate tiers, NOIZ adapts quality based on viewer demand and infrastructure ‚Äî creators are never penalized for having fewer viewers.

### 4. Quests: Sponsored Viewer Engagement

**Quests** are platform-issued engagement campaigns ‚Äî designed by **NOIZ, verified game publishers, or official sponsors** ‚Äî to reward participation and support from viewers across the platform.

These **goal-driven activities** are not created by individual creators but are offered through opt-in eligibility based on channel rating, game tag, or event participation.

Viewers complete quests by performing verified actions such as:

* Watching a stream for a specific duration
* Sending chat messages
* Triggering boosts or overlays
* Gifting subs or completing event interactions

On completion, **viewers may receive**:

* dB (faded Decibels)
* Cosmetic badges, stickers, or overlays
* Progress toward milestone badges or viewer levels

All quest mechanics are **action-based and non-purchasable** ‚Äî meaning no skipping, no pay-to-win, and no off-platform engagement. Participation is rewarded purely through meaningful involvement.

Some quests may also reward creators indirectly (‚ö°Ô∏édB earned if a viewer completes a quest on their channel), but creators do not administer or customize these quests directly.

### 5. Relays: The Backbone of NOIZ Infrastructure

Unlike traditional centralized streaming platforms, NOIZ runs on a distributed relay network powered by trusted members of the community ‚Äî called **Pathweavers**.

**Relays** are:

* Lightweight nodes that forward video data to viewers
* Selected automatically based on latency, trust score, and uptime
* Not responsible for moderation or content ‚Äî only transmission

Relay operators may earn **‚ö°Ô∏édB (charged Decibels)** as a reward for hosting reliable bandwidth and contributing to stream delivery. This is framed strictly as **support-based recognition**, not mining or payment.

NOIZ‚Äôs system monitors each relay‚Äôs performance with internal checks, including:

* Packet delivery integrity
* Latency variability
* Load balancing efficiency

There are no tokens to mine, no external chains, and no speculative value ‚Äî relays are rewarded through internal systems to maintain a stable, fair network.

### 6. How Everything Connects

NOIZ‚Äôs streaming ecosystem is tightly interwoven:

* **Channels** house the content and creator identity
* **Streams** deliver that content through optimized, low-latency infrastructure
* **Quests** turn passive viewers into active participants by offering incentives for engagement
* **Relays** carry the stream to viewers around the world, powered by community bandwidth

All of this is sustained by **Decibels**, which exist in two forms:

| Type | Earned How                     | Cashout Eligible?               |
| ---- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| dB   | Purchased via Constellation    | ‚ùå No                            |
| ‚ö°Ô∏édB | Earned through support actions | ‚úÖ Yes (with legal verification) |

This system ensures that:

* Viewers can support creators using virtual tokens
* Creators can earn ‚ö°Ô∏édB based on real platform activity
* Infrastructure hosts (Pathweavers) are recognized for helping power the platform
* No one ‚Äúpays‚Äù or ‚Äúpurchases‚Äù services ‚Äî everything remains within the digital ecosystem
